Little project to solve the min-cut problem in 3-uniform [hypergraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph) in the context of the [Advanced Algorithms](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/advanced-algorithms-CS-450) course taught at EPFL.

It is implemented by extending the famous [Karger Stein algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm "Wiki to Karger Stein algorithm").
